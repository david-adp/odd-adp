# ADP Coding Challenge

## Challenge 1

Create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns an array of only the odd numbers.  The function must not use looping or libraries that use looping (e.g. no user of "filter").

Note: Not sure what exactly is meant by `looping` because unless you go through each array element ( which is looping ) how else would you determing if an element is odd or even. So, I asumed looping in this context mean loops such as `for` and `while` or `arguments`

## Error checking for valid input is neither asked nor implemented
